Welcome!

About
=====
I’m going to write a simple tutorial series for mobile development with Python. I’ll be using Android, but feel free to use Android or iOS. It’s a short tutorial, just to help you to understand and learn how to work with Python for Mobile. 

I – About the tutorials
=======================

I’ll show you how to use each mobile API, like compass, camera, sensors, sound, and others. After the API, we will start to test some Python libs, as PyGame and OpenCV. I’m using Android with buildozer, but some libs are compatible with iOS too(I’ll tell you when it’s compatible), so if you test it, send a feedback if possible.

I’ll show a sample app using each mobile feature, and after the features, powerful Python libs, as PyGame and OpenCV. When I finish all the tutorial, you will be able to develop almost any app with Python. 

To be able to read all the tutorials, please follow my blog(http://bytedebugger.wordpress.com/) or subscribe your email to get updates.
